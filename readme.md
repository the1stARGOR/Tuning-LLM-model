In today's data-driven world, the ability to process and generate natural language text at scale has become a transformative force across industries. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a cutting-edge advancement in natural language processing, enabling businesses to extract valuable insights, automate tasks, and enhance user experiences. By harnessing the power of LLMs, organizations can improve customer service, automate content creation, and gain a competitive edge in the digital landscape.

This project builds the foundation for Large Language Models by diving deep into the details of their inner workings. Moreover, It shows how to optimize their use through prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA. 

Prompt engineering techniques involve crafting specific instructions or queries given to the language model to influence its output will be introduced to guide LLMs in generating desired responses through zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences.

Fine-tuning entails training a pre-trained language model on a specific task or dataset to adapt it for a particular application. It explores full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT), a technique that optimizes the fine-tuning process by focusing on a subset of the model's parameters, making it more resource-efficient.

The project also involves the application of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, resulting in the development of a chatbot for online shopping for knowledge grounding. Knowledge grounding with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented to mitigate hallucinations and provide trustworthy and reliable responses. This is achieved by incorporating information from external sources to validate and support the generated text.

For example, in the context of an e-commerce chatbot using RAG, knowledge grounding ensures that product information, availability, and prices are sourced from a trusted database or e-commerce platform. This prevents the chatbot from generating inaccurate or fictional details and instead provides responses based on real-world data.
